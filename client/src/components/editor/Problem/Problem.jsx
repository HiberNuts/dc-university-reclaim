        In a quaint town, a central bulletin board is the heart of community
        communication. However, there's no way to track the popularity of each
        announcement. To solve this, the town creates the "Community Counter"
        smart contract. Whenever a resident interacts with an announcement—be it
        checking event details or reading a notice—the counter increments.
        Weekly, the town council reviews the counts to gauge community interest.
        This simple solution empowers the town to better serve its residents and
        strengthen community bonds. Your smart contract must contain the
        following public functions / constructor
